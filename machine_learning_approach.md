# Recidivism Prediction

## Machine Learning Approach
In order to tackle the problem of developing a machine learning algorithm to determine which characteristics (features) of an inmate contribute more to recidivism, the following approach will be used:

- Use a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm with the target variable being 'Return to Prison'.
  - A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm is used as there is a target variable that can be used to predict the accuracy of the Machine Learning Algorithm.  
  - The 'Return to Prison' variable is set as the target as it tells us whether the prisoner returned to prison within 3 years of being out of prison.
- The following options are then available to use within Supervised Machine Learning:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest Model
  - Neural Network
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Out of the above models, we will be using the Decision Tree Model. This is because it will be easier to interpret and the dataset is not too large.
